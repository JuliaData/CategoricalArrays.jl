# Overview

This package provides a replacement for [DataArrays.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/DataArrays.jl)'s `PooledDataArray` type. Contrary to that type, it supports both non-nullable and nullable arrays (i.e. arrays allowing for missing data), using the [`Null`](https://github.com/JuliaData/Nulls.jl) type. It is also based on a simpler design by only supporting categorical data, which allows offering more specialized features (like ordering of categories). See the [IndirectArrays.jl](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/IndirectArrays.jl) package for a simpler array type storing data with a small number of values.

The package provides the `CategoricalArray` type designed to hold categorical data (either unordered/nominal or ordered/ordinal) efficiently and conveniently. `CategoricalArray{T}` holds values of type `T`. `CategoricalArray{?T}`, a.k.a. `CategoricalArray{Union{Null, T}}`, either holds values of type `T`, or missing values (represented as `null`, of the [`Null`](https://github.com/JuliaData/Nulls.jl) type). When indexed, `CategoricalArray{T}` returns values of type `CategoricalValue{T}` rather than of type `T` (or `null` for missing values).

`CategoricalValue` objects are simple wrappers around the actual categorical levels which allow for very efficient extraction and equality tests. Indeed, the main feature of categorical arrays types is that they store a pool of the levels which can appear in the variable. These levels are stored in a specific order: for unordered arrays, this order is only used for pretty printing (e.g. in cross tables or plots); for ordered arrays, it also allows comparing values using the `<` and `>` operators: the comparison is then based on the ordering of levels stored in the array. Whether an array is ordered can be defined either on construction via the `ordered` argument, or at any time via the `ordered!` function.

Use the `levels` function to access the levels of a categorical array, and the `levels!` function to set and order them. Levels are automatically created when setting an element to a previously unused level. On the other hand, they are never removed without manual intervention: use the `droplevels!` function for this.
